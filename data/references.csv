Journal Article,"Chen F,Wan H,Cai H,Cheng G",Machine learning in/for blockchain: Future and challenges,Canadian Journal of Statistics,"Machine learning and blockchain are two of the most notable technologies of recent years. The first is the foundation of artificial intelligence and big data analysis, and the second has significantly disrupted the financial industry. Both technologies are data‐driven, and thus there are rapidly growing interests in integrating both for more secure and efficient data sharing and analysis. In this article, we review existing research on combining machine learning and blockchain technologies and demonstrate that they can collaborate efficiently and effectively. In the end, we point out some future directions and expect more research on deeper integration of these two promising technologies.",2021,49,4,1364-1382,,Wiley Online Library,,2021
Journal Article,"Wang T,Liew SC,Zhang S",When blockchain meets AI: Optimal mining strategy achieved by machine learning,International Journal of Intelligent Systems,"This study applies reinforcement learning (RL) from the AI machine learning field to derive an optimal Bitcoin‐like blockchain mining strategy. A salient feature of the RL learning framework is that an optimal (or near‐optimal) strategy can be obtained without knowing the details of the blockchain network model. Previously, the most profitable mining strategy was believed to be honest mining encoded in the default blockchain protocol. It was shown later that it is possible to gain more mining rewards by deviating from honest mining. In particular, the mining problem can be formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) which can be solved to give the optimal mining strategy. However, solving the mining MDP requires knowing the values of various parameters that characterize the blockchain network model. In real blockchain networks, these parameter values are not easy to obtain and may change over time. This hinders the use of the MDP model‐based solution. In this study, we employ RL to dynamically learn a mining strategy with performance approaching that of the optimal mining strategy. Since the mining MDP problem has a nonlinear objective function (rather than linear functions of standard MDP problems), we design a new multidimensional RL algorithm to solve the problem. Experimental results indicate that, without knowing the parameter values of the mining MDP model, our multidimensional RL mining algorithm can still achieve optimal performance over time‐varying blockchain networks.",2021,36,5,2183-2207,,Wiley Online Library,,2021
Journal Article,"Zhang L,Zhang F",Understand Waiting Time in Transaction Fee Mechanism: An Interdisciplinary Perspective,arXiv preprint arXiv:2305. 02552,"Blockchain enables peer-to-peer transactions in cyberspace without a trusted third party. The rapid growth of Ethereum and smart contract blockchains generally calls for well-designed Transaction Fee Mechanisms (TFMs) to allocate limited storage and computation resources. However, existing research on TFMs must consider the waiting time for transactions, which is essential for computer security and economic efficiency. Integrating data from the Ethereum blockchain and memory pool (mempool), we explore how two types of events affect transaction latency. First, we apply regression discontinuity design (RDD) to study the causal inference of the Merge, the most recent significant upgrade of Ethereum. Our results show that the Merge significantly reduces the long waiting time, network loads, and market congestion. In addition, we verify our results' robustness by inspecting other compounding factors, such as censorship and unobserved delays of transactions via private changes. Second, examining three major protocol changes during the merge, we identify block interval shortening as the most plausible cause for our empirical results. Furthermore, in a mathematical model, we show block interval as a unique mechanism design choice for EIP1559 TFM to achieve better security and efficiency, generally applicable to the market congestion caused by demand surges. Finally, we apply time series analysis to research the interaction of Non-Fungible token (NFT) drops and market congestion using Facebook Prophet, an open-source algorithm for generating time-series models. Our study identified NFT drops as a unique source of market congestion -- holiday effects -- beyond trend and season effects. Finally, we envision three future research directions of TFM.",2023,,,,,,,2023
Conference Paper,"Liu Y,Zhang L",Cryptocurrency valuation: An explainable ai approach,,"Currently, there are no convincing proxies for the fundamentals of cryptocurrency assets. We propose a new market-to-fundamental ratio, the price-to-utility (PU) ratio, utilizing unique blockchain accounting methods. We then proxy various existing fundamental-to-market ratios by Bitcoin historical data and find they have little predictive power for short-term bitcoin returns. However, PU ratio effectively predicts long-term bitcoin returns than alternative methods. Furthermore, we verify the explainability of PU ratio using machine learning. Finally, we present an automated trading strategy advised by the PU ratio that outperforms the conventional buy-and-hold and market-timing strategies. Our research contributes to explainable AI in finance from three facets: First, our market-to-fundamental ratio is based on classic monetary theory and the unique UTXO model of Bitcoin accounting rather than ad hoc; Second, the empirical evidence testifies the buy-low and sell-high implications of the ratio; Finally, we distribute the trading algorithms as open-source software via Python Package Index for future research, which is exceptional in finance research.",2023,,,785-807,Springer,,Science and Information Conference,2023
Conference Paper,"Liu Y,Lu Y,Nayak K,Zhang F,Zhang L,Zhao Y","Empirical analysis of eip-1559: Transaction fees, waiting times, and consensus security",,"A transaction fee mechanism (TFM) is an essential component of a blockchain protocol. However, a systematic evaluation of the real-world impact of TFMs is still absent. Using rich data from the Ethereum blockchain, the mempool, and exchanges, we study the effect of EIP-1559, one of the earliest-deployed TFMs that depart from the traditional first-price auction paradigm. We conduct a rigorous and comprehensive empirical study to examine its causal effect on blockchain transaction fee dynamics, transaction waiting times, and consensus security. Our results show that EIP-1559 improves the user experience by mitigating intrablock differences in the gas price paid and reducing users' waiting times. However, EIP-1559 has only a small effect on gas fee levels and consensus security. In addition, we find that when Ether's price is more volatile, the waiting time is significantly higher. We also verify that a larger block size increases the presence of siblings. These findings suggest new directions for improving TFMs.",2022,,,2099-2113,,,Proceedings of the 2022 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2022
Conference Paper,"Bar-Zur R,Abu-Hanna A,Eyal I,Tamar A","WeRLman: to tackle whale (transactions), go deep (RL)",,"Blockchain technology is responsible for the emergence of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The security of a blockchain protocol relies on the incentives of its participants. Selfish mining is a form of deviation from the protocol where a participant can gain more than her fair share. Previous analyses of selfish mining make easing, non-realistic assumptions. We introduce a more realistic model with varying block rewards in the form of transaction fees. However, this comes at the cost of an intractable state space. To solve the complex model, we introduce WeRLman, a novel method based on deep Reinforcement Learning (deep RL). Using WeRLman, we show reward variability can significantly hurt blockchain security.",2022,,,148-148,,,Proceedings of the 15th ACM International Conference on Systems and Storage,2022
Journal Article,"Hou C,Zhou M,Ji Y,Daian P,Tramer F,Fanti G,Juels A",SquirRL: Automating attack analysis on blockchain incentive mechanisms with deep reinforcement learning,arXiv preprint arXiv:1912. 01798,"Incentive mechanisms are central to the functionality of permissionless blockchains: they incentivize participants to run and secure the underlying consensus protocol. Designing incentive-compatible incentive mechanisms is notoriously challenging, however. As a result, most public blockchains today use incentive mechanisms whose security properties are poorly understood and largely untested. In this work, we propose SquirRL, a framework for using deep reinforcement learning to analyze attacks on blockchain incentive mechanisms. We demonstrate SquirRL's power by first recovering known attacks: (1) the optimal selfish mining attack in Bitcoin [52], and (2) the Nash equilibrium in block withholding attacks [16]. We also use SquirRL to obtain several novel empirical results. First, we discover a counterintuitive flaw in the widely used rushing adversary model when applied to multi-agent Markov games with incomplete information. Second, we demonstrate that the optimal selfish mining strategy identified in [52] is actually not a Nash equilibrium in the multi-agent selfish mining setting. In fact, our results suggest (but do not prove) that when more than two competing agents engage in selfish mining, there is no profitable Nash equilibrium. This is consistent with the lack of observed selfish mining in the wild. Third, we find a novel attack on a simplified version of Ethereum's finalization mechanism, Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (FFG) that allows a strategic agent to amplify her rewards by up to 30%. Notably, [10] show that honest voting is a Nash equilibrium in Casper FFG: our attack shows that when Casper FFG is composed with selfish mining, this is no longer the case. Altogether, our experiments demonstrate SquirRL's flexibility and promise as a framework for studying attack settings that have thus far eluded theoretical and empirical understanding.",2019,,,,,,,2019
Conference Paper,"Nadeem A,Vos D,Cao C,Pajola L,Dieck S,Baumgartner R,Verwer S",Sok: Explainable machine learning for computer security applications,,"Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to improve the transparency of machine learning (ML) pipelines. We systematize the increasingly growing (but fragmented) microcosm of studies that develop and utilize XAI methods for defensive and offensive cybersecurity tasks. We identify 3 cybersecurity stakeholders, i.e., model users, designers, and adversaries, who utilize XAI for 4 distinct objectives within an ML pipeline, namely 1) XAI-enabled user assistance, 2) XAI-enabled model verification, 3) explanation verification & robustness, and 4) offensive use of explanations. Our analysis of the literature indicates that many of the XAI applications are designed with little understanding of how they might be integrated into analyst workflows – user studies for explanation evaluation are conducted in only 14% of the cases. The security literature sometimes also fails to disentangle the role of the various stakeholders, e.g., by providing explanations to model users and designers while also exposing them to adversaries. Additionally, the role of model designers is particularly minimized in the security literature. To this end, we present an illustrative tutorial for model designers, demonstrating how XAI can help with model verification. We also discuss scenarios where interpretability by design may be a better alternative. The systematization and the tutorial enable us to challenge several assumptions, and present open problems that can help shape the future of XAI research within cybersecurity.",2023,,,221-240,IEEE,,2023 IEEE 8th European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P),2023
Journal Article,"Jiang H,Nagra J,Ahammad P",Sok: Applying machine learning in security-a survey,arXiv preprint arXiv:1611. 03186,"The idea of applying machine learning(ML) to solve problems in security domains is almost 3 decades old. As information and communications grow more ubiquitous and more data become available, many security risks arise as well as appetite to manage and mitigate such risks. Consequently, research on applying and designing ML algorithms and systems for security has grown fast, ranging from intrusion detection systems(IDS) and malware classification to security policy management(SPM) and information leak checking. In this paper, we systematically study the methods, algorithms, and system designs in academic publications from 2008-2015 that applied ML in security domains. 98 percent of the surveyed papers appeared in the 6 highest-ranked academic security conferences and 1 conference known for pioneering ML applications in security. We examine the generalized system designs, underlying assumptions, measurements, and use cases in active research. Our examinations lead to 1) a taxonomy on ML paradigms and security domains for future exploration and exploitation, and 2) an agenda detailing open and upcoming challenges. Based on our survey, we also suggest a point of view that treats security as a game theory problem instead of a batch-trained ML problem.",2016,,,,,,,2016
Journal Article,"Tanwar S,Bhatia Q,Patel P,Kumari A,Singh PK,Hong WC","Machine learning adoption in blockchain-based smart applications: The challenges, and a way forward",IEEE Access,"In recent years, the emergence of blockchain technology (BT) has become a unique, most disruptive, and trending technology. The decentralized database in BT emphasizes data security and privacy. Also, the consensus mechanism in it makes sure that data is secured and legitimate. Still, it raises new security issues such as majority attack and double-spending. To handle the aforementioned issues, data analytics is required on blockchain based secure data. Analytics on these data raises the importance of arisen technology Machine Learning (ML). ML involves the rational amount of data to make precise decisions. Data reliability and its sharing are very crucial in ML to improve the accuracy of results. The combination of these two technologies (ML and BT) can provide highly precise results. In this paper, we present a detailed study on ML adoption for making BT-based smart applications more resilient against attacks. There are various traditional ML techniques, for instance, Support Vector Machines (SVM), clustering, bagging, and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM) can be used to analyse the attacks on a blockchain-based network. Further, we include how both the technologies can be applied in several smart applications such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), Smart Grid (SG), healthcare, and smart cities. Then, future research issues and challenges are explored. At last, a case study is presented with a conclusion.",2019,8,,474-488,,IEEE,,2019
Journal Article,"Waheed N,He X,Ikram M,Usman M,Hashmi SS,Usman M",Security and privacy in IoT using machine learning and blockchain: Threats and countermeasures,ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR),"Security and privacy of users have become significant concerns due to the involvement of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices in numerous applications. Cyber threats are growing at an explosive pace making the existing security and privacy measures inadequate. Hence, everyone on the Internet is a product for hackers. Consequently, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used to produce accurate outputs from large complex databases, where the generated outputs can be used to predict and detect vulnerabilities in IoT-based systems. Furthermore, Blockchain (BC) techniques are becoming popular in modern IoT applications to solve security and privacy issues. Several studies have been conducted on either ML algorithms or BC techniques. However, these studies target either security or privacy issues using ML algorithms or BC techniques, thus posing a need for a combined survey on efforts made in recent years addressing both security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BC techniques. In this article, we provide a summary of research efforts made in the past few years, from 2008 to 2019, addressing security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BC techniques in the IoT domain. First, we discuss and categorize various security and privacy threats reported in the past 12 years in the IoT domain. We then classify the literature on security and privacy efforts based on ML algorithms and BC techniques in the IoT domain.

Journal Article,"Li D,Han D,Weng TH,Zheng Z,Li H,Liu H,Castiglione A,Li KC",Blockchain for federated learning toward secure distributed machine learning systems: a systemic survey,Soft Computing,"Federated learning (FL) is a promising decentralized deep learning technology, which allows users to update models cooperatively without sharing their data. FL is reshaping existing industry paradigms for mathematical modeling and analysis, enabling an increasing number of industries to build privacy-preserving, secure distributed machine learning models. However, the inherent characteristics of FL have led to problems such as privacy protection, communication cost, systems heterogeneity, and unreliability model upload in actual operation. Interestingly, the integration with Blockchain technology provides an opportunity to further improve the FL security and performance, besides increasing its scope of applications. Therefore, we denote this integration of Blockchain and FL as the Blockchain-based federated learning (BCFL) framework. This paper introduces an in-depth survey of BCFL and discusses the insights of such a new paradigm. In particular, we first briefly introduce the FL technology and discuss the challenges faced by such technology. Then, we summarize the Blockchain ecosystem. Next, we highlight the structural design and platform of BCFL.

Journal Article,"Zhu J,Cao J,Saxena D,Jiang S,Ferradi H","Blockchain-empowered federated learning: Challenges, solutions, and future directions",ACM Computing Surveys,"Federated learning is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique that trains models across multiple devices holding local data samples without exchanging them. There are many challenging issues in federated learning, such as coordinating participants’ activities, arbitrating their benefits, and aggregating models. Most existing solutions employ a centralized approach, in which a trustworthy central authority is needed for coordination. Such an approach incurs many disadvantages, including vulnerability to attacks, lack of credibility, and difficulty in calculating rewards. Recently, blockchain was identified as a potential solution for addressing the abovementioned issues. Extensive research has been conducted, and many approaches, methods, and techniques have been proposed. There is a need for a systematic survey to examine how blockchain can empower federated learning. Although there are many surveys on federated learning, few of them cover blockchain as an enabling technology. This work comprehensively surveys challenges, solutions, and future directions for blockchain-empowered federated learning (BlockFed). First, we identify the critical issues in federated learning and explain why blockchain provides a potential approach to addressing these issues. Second, we categorize existing system models into three classes: decoupled, coupled, and overlapped, according to how the federated learning and blockchain functions are integrated. Then we compare the advantages and disadvantages of these three system models, regard the disadvantages as challenging issues in BlockFed, and investigate corresponding solutions. Finally, we identify and discuss the future directions, including open problems in BlockFed.",2023,55,11,1-31,,"ACM New York, NY",,2023

Journal Article,Gong Y,Dynamic large language models on blockchains,arXiv preprint arXiv:2307. 10549,"Training and deploying the large language models requires a large mount of computational resource because the language models contain billions of parameters and the text has thousands of tokens. Another problem is that the large language models are static. They are fixed after the training process. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose to train and deploy the dynamic large language model on blockchains, which have high computation performance and are distributed across a network of computers. A blockchain is a secure, decentralized, and transparent system that allows for the creation of a tamper-proof ledger for transactions without the need for intermediaries.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of BlockGPT through its use as an anomaly detection tool for Ethereum transactions. In our experiments, it effectively identifies abnormal transactions among a dataset of 68M transactions and has a batched throughput of 2284 transactions per second on average. Our results show that, BlockGPT identifies abnormal transactions by ranking 49 out of 124 attacks among the top-3 most abnormal transactions interacting with their victim contracts.

Journal Article,"Qu Y,Uddin MP,Gan C,Xiang Y,Gao L,Yearwood J",Blockchain-enabled federated learning: A survey,ACM Computing Surveys,"Federated learning (FL) has experienced a boom in recent years, which is jointly promoted by the prosperity of machine learning and Artificial Intelligence along with emerging privacy issues. In the FL paradigm, a central server and local end devices maintain the same model by exchanging model updates instead of raw data, with which the privacy of data stored on end devices is not directly revealed. In this way, the privacy violation caused by the growing collection of sensitive data can be mitigated. However, the performance of FL with a central server is reaching a bottleneck, while new threats are emerging simultaneously. There are various reasons, among which the most significant ones are centralized processing, data falsification, and lack of incentives. To accelerate the proliferation of FL, blockchain-enabled FL has attracted substantial attention from both academia and industry. A considerable number of novel solutions are devised to meet the emerging demands of diverse scenarios.
